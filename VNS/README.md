# VNS (Variable Neighborhood Search)
Variable neighborhood search (VNS) is a metaheuristic method for solving a set of combinatorial optimization and global optimization problems. It explores distant neighborhoods of the current incumbent solution and moves from there to a new one if and only if an improvement was made. The local search method is applied repeatedly to get from solutions in the neighborhood to local optima.

Given the large solution space of the integrated airline robust scheduling problem, VNS algorithm seeks to explore high quality solution through generating and improving the base aircraft paths instead of fully searching decision values on routing, re-timing and passenger flow assignment.

First of all let's define the following terms. A flight route p = {fi,..., fk} is a combination of flights f where an aircraft is able to successively execute all flights with re-timing possibility (i.e. likely to be connected after re-timing). A flight-copy route s = {fci,..., fck}, instead, is a sequence of flight copies fc. In other words, a flight-copy route is the corresponding flight route after re-timing.
Based on flight routes and flight-copy routes, basic solutions are generated by assigning different flight-copy routes or flight routes to individual aircraft, forming flight route solutions P = {p1, . . . , p|A|} and flight-copy solutions S = {s1, . . . , s|A|} respectively. 

## Neighborhood

Class that implements a neighborhood. There four types of neighborhood structures to generate flight route solution pairs: cross, insert, swap, and delete. These neighborhoods provide effective probing to new solutions with varying search depth. We introduce several notations first:
• dep(f): Departure airport of flight f
• arr(f): Arrival airport of flight f
• con(fi, fj): fi can be connected to fj
