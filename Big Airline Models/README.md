# BIG AIRLINE MODELS

The code of the big airline selected is "THY". This company has 1274 flights per day.

Running model 1 for the large airline could takes hours. In the case of model 2 it is even intractable due to the immense number of variables and constraints. While using VNS it can take about ten minutes to obtain a good result, not the optimal, but it's close.
